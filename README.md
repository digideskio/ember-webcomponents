# ember-webcomponents

Easily load and use web components in your Ember project.

This addon takes care of compiling all components into one file (using Polymer's [vulcanize](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize)).

## Installation

~~~sh
ember install ember-webcomponents
ember generate ember-webcomponents
~~~

## Usage

Create app/webcomponents.html and import all your web components inside of it:

~~~html
<!--
This file belongs at app/webcomponents.html. It will load all your web components as a single file, rather than a bunch of individual link requests.

You can customize the components loaded here if you don't need certain things or want to add your own custom elements.
-->
